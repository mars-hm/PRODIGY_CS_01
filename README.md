# PRODIGY_CS_01
This repository contains code for Prodigy Infotech Internship Task 1 (Caesar Cipher).

## Task 1: Caesar Cipher
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## NOTE: Deployment
The following python program has been deployed using Streamlit

## Implementation
Caesar Cipher is a classical cryptography technique based on the principle of shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. It involves substituting each letter in the plaintext with another letter by a fixed distance right (or left) the alphabet, determined by a key (shift value).
In the python program created, the values of the alphabets are as follows: A=0, ....., Z=25 & a=26, ......, z=51
